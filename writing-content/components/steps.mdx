The Steps component allows you to create numbered step-by-step instructions in your documentation. Steps are automatically numbered based on their order in the MDX file.

## Basic Usage

<Demo>
  <UiDisplay>
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        You can include *markdown* content **here**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Formatting like tables, code, and lists:
        <></>
        1. One
        <></>
        2. Two
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        You can even include other components:
        <Callout type="tip">
          To prevent lists from collapsing when auto-formatting on save, try
          using `<></>` where you want line breaks to be maintained.
        </Callout>
